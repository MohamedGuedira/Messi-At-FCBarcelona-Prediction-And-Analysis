# Messi Goals Analysis and Prediction at FC Barcelona

## âš½ About the Project

Lionel Messi, one of the greatest football players of all time, spent most of his career breaking records and dazzling fans at FC Barcelona. This project explores Messi's goal-scoring patterns at Barcelona, analyzing his performances across competitions, seasons, and situations. 

The project also takes a step into the future, using machine learning to predict the number of goals Messi might have scored if he stayed at FC Barcelona for five more seasons. 

Through visualizations and predictive modeling, we gain a deeper appreciation of Messi's brilliance and imagine what his future might have looked like at his home club.
